## Project 1 for Doug Lea's Fall 2019 Data Structures and Algorithms Class

### Project Background:

1. Use a GUI to allow a user to input a Wikipedia page and return a similar page.

2. Create a Web Scraper to scrape text from Wikipedia Pages and save them to text files. The Wikipedia Pages should be sanitized before saving to text. The pages to be scraped can be saved as a text file.

3. Create a Custom Hash Table to store each Wikipedia Page.

4. Use a Similarity Metric(TF-IDF or other Term Frequency Metrics) to calculate which Wikipedia Page is most similar to the user input.

### Requirements To Run:

1. Needs jsoup for the Web Scraping elements

2. Developed on Java 11
